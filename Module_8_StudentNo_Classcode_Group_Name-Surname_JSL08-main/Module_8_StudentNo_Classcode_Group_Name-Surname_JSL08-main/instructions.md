Design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer can significantly improve the structure and maintainability of your JavaScript projects, making your code cleaner and more efficient. By understanding and applying these patterns, you'll be well-equipped to tackle complex design challenges in your projects, just as a well-organized bank efficiently manages its operations and services.
